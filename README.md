# AgiPal: Task Assignment System (In Progress)

# TODO: Pivot the project and get something published.

Machine learning applied to task assignment within a software organization, as a means of improving the standard Agile software development cycle. These efforts are a part of my undergraduate research at Washington State University under Jana Doppa, Ph. D.

Check out my progress reports over [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/17N2bRCSWOirAeS_4AD8ImuqxuisNkwwLAUuS1U-0JJo/ditusp=sharing).

Also, see the project proposal over [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SsWqcaKHSgFPztiEcrmhE0EpCseiNxIIAigREo-RE14/edit?usp=sharing).

If you see any errors in either the source code or my project proposal, feel free to point them out to me! I'd appreciate it.
