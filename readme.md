Framework designed for my research; intelligent task scheduling/assignment as a means to improving the standard software development cycle.

Check out my progress reports over [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/17N2bRCSWOirAeS_4AD8ImuqxuisNkwwLAUuS1U-0JJo/edit?usp=sharing).

Also, see the project proposal over [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SsWqcaKHSgFPztiEcrmhE0EpCseiNxIIAigREo-RE14/edit?usp=sharing).
